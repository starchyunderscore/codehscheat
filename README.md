### What is it?
CodeHScheat is a userscript to automatically cheat on codehs.com
### How do I use it?
Install the userscript with any userscript manager, then go to a codeHS assignment. It will automatically put in the answer and go on to the next assignment, including completing quizzes and skipping videos and examples
### It's saying "There is not an answer for this assignment yet"
I haven't uploaded an answer to the assignment yet. You can contribute one if you want. See [answerFormat.md](https://github.com/starchyunderscore/codehscheat/blob/main/answerFormat.md).
You can also submit an issue asking me to put in the answers, but that may take some time
